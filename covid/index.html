These include not just respiratory but also <b>cognitive, cardiovascular, and autoimmune</b> (every organ is susceptible). In other words, long COVID can be <b>disabling</b>.</p><p>Some of the most common symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, short-term memory loss, breathlessness, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, all of which have <b>already been harming economies</b> (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/31/1114375163/long-covid-longhaulers-disability-labor-ada">NPR (US)</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/33444f29-bab1-4655-85b5-c0b1f68d9653">Financial Times (UK)</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-06-15/long-covid-is-showing-up-in-the-employment-data">Bloomberg</a>). <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-tsunami-of-disability-is-coming-as-a-result-of-lsquo-long-covid-rsquo/">A tsunami of disability is coming as a result of ‚Äòlong COVID‚Äô.</a></p><p><b><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220622.htm">Nearly 1 in 5 American adults who have had COVID-19 still have ‚Äúlong COVID‚Äù</a></b>. Another study in the Netherlands (Aug 2022) shows that <b><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/covid-study-gives-powerful-clues-to-pandemic-s-lasting-impact">1 in 8 COVID patients experience lingering symptoms.</a></b></p><p>If these statistics still don‚Äôt seem high, keep in mind that the <b>recent subvariants are the most immune-evasive we‚Äôve seen</b>, meaning reinfection risk is much higher and potentially challenges the effectiveness of existing vaccines, and absolute risk of those experiencing ‚Äúlong COVID‚Äù remains high. (<a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/a-reinfection-red-flag">Eric Topol</a>)</p><p>(Also yes, for those of us who have caught COVID at least once before: it‚Äôs complex, but there is some evidence that <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/07/03/long-covid-whos-most-at-risk-of-developing/">repeat infections may put you at higher risk to develop long COVID</a>!)</p><p>Additionally, consistently <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ahandvanish/status/1558190386463625217">about half of all long COVID patients</a></b> contract symptoms consistent with ME/CFS (Myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue symptom) - ‚Äúan <b>untreatable, disabling, lifelong condition</b> that renders many homebound and even bedbound.‚Äù</p><p>ME/CFS is already considered ‚Äúoften misunderstood and might not be taken seriously by some healthcare providers‚Äù (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html">CDC</a>) despite being suffered by millions of people worldwide. The informative film <a href="https://www.unrest.film/">UNREST</a> portrays these struggles.</p><p>Bottom line, <b>long COVID is debilitating</b>, and recent increased risk of (re)infections make it crucial for us to continue putting in serious effort to avoid infection and spreading infection, both for ourselves and for others.</p><h4>What we can do now</h4><p><b>Wear a quality mask.</b> Concerningly, the latest variant is highly transmissible outdoors, so yes, it will be effective to wear outdoors as well. During my summer in Japan, everyone masked indoors and outdoors even in 90-100+ F temperatures, even after the government loosened outdoor masking requirements. Pedestrians who let down their masks to endure the heat always pulled them back up when passing other pedestrians. While I don‚Äôt dream that we can change the American attitude towards masking overnight, I hope we can start to see it as a way to protect others than as an inconvenience.</p><p>Some websites for affordable quality masks are <a href="https://www.projectn95.org/">Project N95</a> and <a href="https://bonafidemasks.com/">Bona Fide Masks</a>.</p><p><b>Get tested regularly.</b> For those of us living or working in Cambridge, CIC Health offers free testing! Use this specific link: <a href="https://www.cic-health.com/cambridge">https://www.cic-health.com/cambridge</a>. And for those on BCBS MA, they are able to send 8 free COVID test kits per month, details available here: <a href="https://www.bluecrossma.org/myblue/at-home-covid-test-coverage">https://www.bluecrossma.org/myblue/at-home-covid-test-coverage</a></p><p>Even with testing, beware that negative test results are not bulletproof - many (including myself) have tested negative on tests for several days into the rise of COVID symptoms.</p><h4>"This is hard and awfully inconvenient. I want to live and enjoy my life like we did pre-COVID!"</h4><p>I get it and I‚Äôve been there - the peer pressure and appealing comfort to go mask-free is hard. But let‚Äôs recognize this as an ableist mindset. These basic precautions are collective behaviors that can keep our community safe. It‚Äôs not only the particularly at-risk populations who will benefit from your precautions, but also any of us who still hope to live a full life without suffering the persistent effects of long COVID.</p><p>I‚Äôm also painfully aware that precautions seem like barriers to the social interactions that so enrich our lives. But all the more to spread awareness so we can all be on board with enjoying social interactions in a safer way. <b>Without precautions, social engagements become exclusionary to anyone at-risk for being disabled by long COVID - which is everyone.</b></p><p>‚ÄúThe rush to ‚Äònormalcy‚Äô papers over the reality that we are not going back to a world before COVID. Like everyone else, I am nostalgic for that world. But <b>I also don‚Äôt want to live in a society that thinks it is okay to sacrifice the vulnerable for its own comfort.</b> There is a difference between the science-backed pursuit of restoring our lives to their fullest possible meaning‚Äîthe joy of spontaneity‚Äîand lying to ourselves that COVID-19 is ‚Äújust the flu.‚Äù We want our old life; we need to build our new one.‚Äù <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/long-covid-public-health-ongoing-risk/671048/">The Atlantic</a></p><h4>If you have been infected or suffer from long COVID</h4><p>I of course do not provide these resources to blame or shame anyone who has been infected. Long COVID patients face stigma on top of suffering the symptoms. Many long COVID patients are not believed by their own family members, friends, and doctors, which is why we may not feel we know many people who have it. Resources such as <a href="https://www.survivorcorps.com/">Survivor Corps</a> exist. I would love to know about more resources on how to better support this community, but I hope this page is a start.</p></div></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep--white"/><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__tags"><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/computational-design">computational design</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/structural-performance">structural performance</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/sustainability">sustainability</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/timber">timber</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/optimization">optimization</a></li></ul><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/demi.fang/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/demifang/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gjcm-WQAAAAJ" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-google scholar"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Demi_Fang" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-researchgate"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><section class="contact popup"><div class="popup__close"><div class="popup__exit"></div></div><div class="contact__container popup__container"><div class="contact__img"><figure class="absolute-bg" style="background-image: url();"></figure></div><div class="contact__content"><div class="contact__mast section-padding--half"><div class="grid"><h2>Contact</h2></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><hr class="sep"/></div><div class="contact__form section-padding--half"><div class="grid-xlarge"> <form id="form" class="form" action="" method="POST"><div class="form__subcontainer"><div> <label for="form-first-name">First Name</label> <input type="text" name="first-name" id="form-first-name" required></div><div> <label for="form-last-name">Last Name</label> <input type="text" name="last-name" id="form-last-name" required></div></div><div> <label for="form-email">E-Mail</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="form-email" required></div><div> <label for="form-message">Message</label> <textarea name="message" id="form-message" rows="3"></textarea></div><div class="form__submit"><div class="form__btn"> <input type="submit" value="Send"></div></div><p class="form__message"></p></form></div></div></div></div></section><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
